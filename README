=  Description: =
The program contains 8 functions:

The first creates and returns a list filled interactively by the respondent.

The second receives a list and returns a string of all its components put
together.

The third receives a list of numbers and returns their average.

The fourth receives two lists and check if the lists are alike, only formatted
by an integer difference, returning True or False accordingly.

The fifth receives a list of numbers and returns a list which indicates,
by slot, how many times the number of each specific slot, showed up in the
original list.

The sixth receives a positive, integer number,
and returns it's prime factors/sources.

The seventh receives two lists and returns a list which each one of it's
components are cartesian duos of the original two lists.

The eighth receives an integer number and a list of numbers and returns a list
which components are duos of the original lists components which add up to the
recieved number.

Special Comments
=
1. cyclic('abcd','bcda') returns True, even though the parameters given
are strings and not lists, as required, because although we assumed that
the parameters which the function receives are lists, we never defined the
program as such, and all the commands used in the function are "legal" when
used on strings just like when used on lists.

2. histogram(3,[1,2,3,4]) returns an Error exit code because the function only
runs when all numbers in the list are in the range of the number given
(in our case 3), and 4 (which is in the list) is not in the range of 3.

3. prime_factors(0) returns [0] because the function was never programmed to
accept only possitive numbers, and so given that 0 is smaller than 2 the
function wont check at all it's prime sources, instead it skips and treats
0 as a prime number of it's own.

4. pairs(2,[0,0,1,1,2,2]) returns [(2, 0), (2, 0), (1, 1)] because we only
assumed that the list which the functions receives is injective,
but we never programmed is to take care of examples which are not so.
